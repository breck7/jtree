# Core

This folder contains the core JTree code. This core code is
used in both the browser lib and node.js lib. 

## What are the differences between browser lib and node lib?

The Node lib contains a dozen or so extra static methods.
The implementations otherwise are almost identical with some
slight overloads for the different environments.
