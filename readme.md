Who this package is for
-----------------------

Jtree is for people who want to design Tree Languages, make
Tree editing tools, use TreeBase, or use the Tree Component
Web Framework.

You can think of jtree as similar to the Java Development
Kit, except for Tree Notation instead of Java.

Grammar Files
-------------

Jtree contains a Tree Language called "Grammar". You can
write new Grammar files to define new languages. By creating
a grammar file you get a parser, a type checker, syntax
highlighting, autocomplete, a compiler, and virtual machine
for executing your new language. Jtree also includes a
simple web [Tree Language Builder]
(https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/).

To make your language do really interesting things, you'll
want to write some code to extend your language nodes in
another language that you know. Jtree lets you create new
languages using just Tree Notation, Tree Notation +
TypeScript, or Tree Notation + Javascript. Tree Notation and
Tree Languages can be built with any language, however, not
just TypeScript and Javascript. We are looking for
volunteers to build libraries/sdks in other host languages.

Using Jtree
-----------

Jtree currently includes around 10 compiled projects (aka
"products") and more than a dozen Tree Languages.

### jtree base library for npm projects:

    const {jtree} = require("jtree")
    const tree = new jtree.TreeNode("hello world")
    console.log(tree.toString())

### jtree base library for the browser:

    <script src="node_modules/jtree/products/jtree.browser.js"

### jtree command line tool

    npm install -g jtree
    jtree help

### TreeBase

    npm install -g jtree
    jtree base

### jtree "sandbox" web app for exploring base Tree Notation

    npm install -g jtree
    jtree kitchen
    open http://localhost:3333/

### jtree "Designer" web app for building new Tree Languages

    npm install -g jtree
    jtree kitchen
    open http://localhost:3333/designer

### TreeComponentFramework for building web apps

(directions coming soon)

### More than 12 example Tree Languages for helping with
various tasks

See the "langs/" folder.

### Build Tools

If you look at the source, you will also see a set of build
tools (such as Builder and TypeScriptRewriter). These are
currently undocumented and not recommended for external use.

### Building all tools and running tests

    jtree build produceAll
    npm test

Monorepo
--------

Jtree is a [monorepo]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo). With on average
over 1 major version released each month for the past 2.5
years, it would take a lot of overhead to constantly be
updating 10+ different repositories and modules every month.
Once we're more confident in the theory and best practices,
it might make sense to break this repo into independent modules.

That being said, we despise unnecessary dependencies as much
as anyone. If anyone wants to create some automated
submodules built from the projects in this monorepo, to
allow for consuming of a smaller subset of the code and
dependencies in this module, feel free to do so.

Development Status
------------------

All breaking changes are mentioned in releaseNotes.md. We
follow semantic versioning, so breaking changes should not
happen if you stay on the same major version.

Tree Notation Libraries in Other Languages
------------------------------------------

If you build a Tree Notation library/SDK in another
language, let us know and we'll add a link.

If you are working on a Tree Notation library in a new host
language, feel free to post an issue or ask for help in the 
[TreeNotation subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/treenotation/).

Alternatives Considered
-----------------------

This is the first Tree Notation library in existence, so
there were no alternative implementations. Note and Space
were predecessors to Tree Notation.

If a better alternative low level notation to Tree Notation
is possible, it has yet to be discovered.

All that said, the important part of this repo is not the
code but the design patterns. Tree Notation is very simple,
and you can implement the patterns contained here in your
own code without using this library. In fact, that is often
the best way to use Tree Notation!

Important
---------

There is a domain
the public domain
the only domain there should be.

Where ideas can mingle
improve and change
So that the people can be free.
